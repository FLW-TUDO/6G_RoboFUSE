Run RVIZ ROSBAG with robot moves (Galactic Version):

Installation:
- Install rona_physical, rona_navigation, and ros_robomaster_description
- Make sure the main scripts to be set in the correct ROS DISTRO:
* MeNu/src/rona_navigation/launch/rviz/robomaster_nav_launch.py
Here, the original code is in line 96 where robocore_cmd is commented. Instead, we run the vicon_cmd to execute ros2 launch rona_physical vicon_tf_converter.launch.py namespace:=ep03
* MeNu/src/rona_navigation/launch/rviz/navigation_launch.py
Original code in lifecycle_nodes is the behavior_server for Humble, but I use recoveries_server for Galactic



How to launch RVIZ:
- ros2 bag play -l scenario --clock
- ros2 launch rona_navigation rosbag_rviz_launch.py namespace:=ep05/ep03
- execute ros2 launch rona_navigation robomaster_nav_launch.py namespace:=ep05/ep03 --> MeNu/src/rona_navigation/launch/rviz/robomaster_nav_launch.py (change robot name in line 126)


Old:
- open the rviz2 from terminal and import config rosbag_play.rviz
- set ros2 param set /rviz use_sim_time true --> to make sure it uses the timestamp from simulation
if the sim_time is not correct, you can use ros2 run rona_navigation timestamp_publisher.py ep03/ep05
- execute ros2 launch rona_navigation robomaster_nav_launch.py --> MeNu/src/rona_navigation/launch/rviz/robomaster_nav_launch.py (change robot name in line 126)

ros2 launch rona_physical vicon_tf_converter.launch.py namespace:=ep03 --> MeNu/src/rona_navigation/launch/rviz/navigation_launch.py
